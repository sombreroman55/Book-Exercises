\subsection*{Exercises 2.1}
To type the indicated passage one would write in \TeX :
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
``I always use an en-dash instead of a hyphen when specifying page numbers like `480--491' in a bibliography.''
\end{lstlisting} 
Which will be rendered as: \\
``I always use an en-dash instead of a hypen when specifying page numbers like `480--491' in a bibliography.'' 

\subsection*{Exercises 2.2}
I'm assuming that four hyphens in a row would be greedily parsed (taking as many hypens as possible), such that it is rendered as an em-dash followed by a normal hypen. Four hyphens is rendered like this: ---- \\ \\
Update from the future: I was right!

\subsection*{Exercises 2.3}
An English word containing two ligatures is ``fluffy''. (The fl and the ff).
